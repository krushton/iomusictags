Tag Radio
================
Tag Radio is a visualization of the top 50 tags from Last.fm. The arrangement of the tags in space represents relatedness; for example, "metal" and "heavy metal" are closer than "metal" and "dance".

Clicking a tag shows the user more information, and lets them listen to some sample tracks.
